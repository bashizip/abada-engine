# 🦄 Abada Engine

**Abada Engine** is a lightweight, embeddable, and cloud-native BPMN 2.0 workflow engine built in modern Java. Designed for developers and teams seeking a streamlined, flexible process automation core — without the bloat, lock-in, or complexity of legacy platforms.

> Inspired by the mythical African unicorn *Abada* — rare, agile, and powerful.

## 🚀 What Makes It Different?

- ✅ **Lightweight and modular** — no heavyweight runtimes
- 🧠 **Developer-first** — clean Java API, simple embedding in any JVM-based application
- 🌐 **REST-first architecture** — can also run fully standalone as a remote workflow service
- 📦 **Container-ready** — easily deployed via Docker in modern CI/CD pipelines
- ☁️ **Cloud-native mindset** — built for microservices, automation, and scale
- ⚙️ **Standard BPMN 2.0 support** — including user tasks, service tasks, and gateways
- 🔐 **Authentication agnostic** — pluggable security handled by your host app
- 🔁 **Process persistence** — reliable state recovery after reboot
- 🧪 **Battle-tested core** — strong test coverage and deterministic behavior
- 📄 **BPMN 2.0 compatible** — fully interoperable with [bpmn.io](https://bpmn.io) and Camunda Modeler

## 💡 Usage Modes

**1. Embedded SDK**  
Use it directly as a Java library inside your Spring Boot (or plain Java) application.

**2. Standalone Engine**  
Run as a self-contained RESTful service. Ideal for frontend clients, no-code tools, or external systems that just need an HTTP interface.

**3. Containerized**  
Deploy with Docker for maximum portability and cloud-native integration.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.4
- H2 (default) — switchable to PostgreSQL or others
- Maven
- Camunda BPMN Model API (for parsing only)
