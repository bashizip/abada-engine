# Abada Engine v0.8.4-alpha Release Notes

**Release Date**: January 30, 2026  
**Status**: Alpha Release  
**Focus**: Tenda MVP & Platform Integration

---

## Overview

Version 0.8.4-alpha marks a significant milestone in the Abada Platform roadmap: the transition from a "headless" engine to an integrated platform. This release introduces the first version of **Abada Tenda** (Tasklist UI) and provides a much-improved development experience for building full-stack workflow applications.

> **Roadmap Context**: This release fulfills the second milestone in the [Roadmap to Beta](docs/development/roadmap.md), focusing on the end-user task lifecycle.

## What's New

### 🖥️ Abada Tenda Integration (MVP)

The engine now supports the initial release of **Abada Tenda**, our specialized Tasklist UI. 
- **Task Lifecycle**: Full support for claiming, completing, and managing user tasks via the UI.
- **Variable Handling**: Users can now view input variables and submit output variables directly through Tenda.
- **Seamless Setup**: Docker Compose now includes Tenda as a first-class service, pre-configured to communicate with the engine.

### 🛠️ Enhanced Process Management

We've expanded the Engine API to provide better control over running processes:
- **New Statuses**: Introduced `CANCELLED` and `SUSPENDED` states for process instances.
- **Management Endpoints**: Added dedicated API endpoints for instance management and job control.
- **External Task Failures**: Improved reporting for external task failures, including error messages and retry logic.

### 🏗️ Improved Developer Experience (DX)

- **Flexible Docker Strategy**: New dedicated `Dockerfile.prod` and streamlined dev/prod configurations.
- **Sibling Project Integration**: The `build-and-run-dev.sh` script now automatically detects and builds sibling projects (`abada-tenda`, `abada-orun`) if they are present in the workspace.
- **Sample Data Generation**: A new utility to populate the engine with realistic sample processes, tasks, and history for testing and demos.

### 🧪 Advanced Instrumentation

- **Process Starter Tracking**: Track who started a process and identify candidate starter groups.
- **PostgreSQL Support**: Added production-ready PostgreSQL driver and configuration for containerized deployments.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Changes
- Refactored `JobController` to move management endpoints to `/v1/jobs`.
- Moved cockpit-specific endpoints to a dedicated controller for better separation of concerns.
- Implemented process instance suspension and cancellation logic in the core engine.

### Infrastructure Update
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to include `abada-tenda` and `abada-orun` services.
- Added `data-local` directory for persistent local development data.
- Optimized OTLP span exporters for better Jaeger integration.
